# Static Directory

This directory contains static assets for the application. Static assets are files that are not processed or loaded by the application, but are, instead, sent to the client as-is (e.g. images, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).

## CSS Subdirectory

The `css` directory contains two css files. These files are rather small as a result of using [Bootstrap5](<https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/>) for most of the styling. The first file, `login.css`, is used to style the login and registration pages. The second file, `errors.css`, is used to style error pages, and is similarly small.

## Images Subdirectory

The `images` directory contains a set of files, which the application uses to display its various backgrounds and such. Additionally, it contains all of the comic pages that are displayed, and it enjoys frequent additions as new comic pages are uploaded.
