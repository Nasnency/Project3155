# Static Directory

This directory contains static assets for the application. Static assets are files that are not processed or loaded by the application, but are, instead, sent to the client as-is (e.g. images, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).

## CSS Subdirectory

The `css` directory contains a single CSS file, `style.css`, which is used to style the front-end of the application. This file is rather small as a result of using [Bootstrap5](<https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/>) for most of the styling and since the application is meant to be mostly skeletal. Students should consider this an easy implementation point when planning the customizations for their group's project.

## Images Subdirectory

The `images` directory contains a set of files, which the application uses to display product images. The filepaths for these images are stored in the application's database, so be mindful of the filepaths when adding, removing, or renaming files in either location.
